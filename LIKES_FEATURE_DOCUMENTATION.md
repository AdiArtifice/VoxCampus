# Likes Feature Implementation Documentation

## 📋 Overview
Successfully implemented a complete likes feature for posts (Events and Sessions) in the VoxCampus app, allowing users to like/unlike posts with real-time updates and persistent storage.

## 🗄️ Backend Implementation (Appwrite)

### Database Collection: `likes`
- **Collection ID**: `likes`
- **Database ID**: `68c58e83000a2666b4d9`
- **Permissions**: 
  - Read: `any` (allows public viewing of like counts)
  - Create/Delete: `users` (only authenticated users can like/unlike)

### Attributes:
- `postId` (string, required, max 100 chars) - References the post being liked
- `userId` (string, required, max 100 chars) - References the user who liked
- `createdAt` (datetime, required) - Timestamp when like was created

### Indexes:
- `user_post_index` - Composite index on `userId` and `postId` for optimized queries

## 🔧 Frontend Implementation

### 1. Custom Hook: `useLikes.ts`
Location: `/hooks/useLikes.ts`

**Purpose**: Manages all likes-related state and operations for a specific post.

**Key Features**:
- **State Management**: Tracks `isLiked`, `likesCount`, and `loading` states
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediately updates UI before backend confirmation
- **Error Handling**: Reverts UI changes if backend operations fail
- **Real-time Sync**: Refreshes data from server after operations

**Core Functions**:
```typescript
const { isLiked, likesCount, toggleLike, loading } = useLikes(postId);
```

### 2. Enhanced PostCard Component
Location: `/components/PostCard.tsx`

**Key Changes**:
- Added `postId` as required prop
- Integrated `useLikes` hook for likes management
- Removed manual `onLike` prop (now handled internally)
- Enhanced UI with VoxCampus branding colors

**Visual Features**:
- ❤️ Like button changes to VoxCampus blue (`#4a90e2`) when liked
- 📊 Real-time likes count display
- ⚡ Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
- 🔒 Disabled state during loading to prevent multiple clicks

### 3. Updated HomeScreen
Location: `/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Pass `postId` to PostCard components
- Added sample posts for development testing
- Removed manual like handling (delegated to PostCard)

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual Design
- **Liked State**: Heart icon turns VoxCampus blue (`#4a90e2`)
- **Likes Count**: Displayed on left side of stats section
- **Comments Count**: Maintained on right side of stats section
- **Loading State**: Button disabled during backend operations

### User Experience
1. **Immediate Feedback**: UI updates instantly when user taps like
2. **Error Recovery**: Reverts changes if backend operation fails
3. **Consistent State**: Refreshes from server to ensure accuracy
4. **Responsive Design**: Works across all screen sizes

## 🔄 How It Works

### Like Process:
1. User taps heart icon
2. UI immediately shows liked state (optimistic update)
3. Backend creates like document with `postId`, `userId`, and `createdAt`
4. Success: UI stays updated, counts refresh from server
5. Error: UI reverts to previous state, error logged

### Unlike Process:
1. User taps liked heart icon
2. UI immediately shows unliked state (optimistic update)
3. Backend finds and deletes matching like document
4. Success: UI stays updated, counts refresh from server
5. Error: UI reverts to previous state, error logged

## 🧪 Testing Features

### Sample Data (Development Only)
- Two sample posts added in development mode
- Demonstrates likes functionality with realistic content
- Automatically removed in production builds

### Error Scenarios Handled:
- ✅ Network failures
- ✅ Authentication errors
- ✅ Database permission issues
- ✅ Concurrent like/unlike operations
- ✅ Missing user session

## 🔒 Security & Performance

### Security Features:
- User authentication required for like operations
- Server-side validation of user permissions
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate likes (via composite index)

### Performance Optimizations:
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
- Composite database index for fast queries
- Efficient state management with React hooks
- Minimal re-renders through proper dependency management

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

The implementation is structured to easily add similar features:

### Ready for Extension:
- **Comments**: Similar pattern with `useComments` hook
- **Shares**: Track sharing activity with `useShares` hook  
- **Saves**: Bookmark functionality with `useSaves` hook
- **Reactions**: Multiple emoji reactions instead of just likes

### Scalability Considerations:
- Database indexes optimized for high-volume queries
- Hook pattern allows easy feature additions
- Component architecture supports multiple interaction types
- Real-time updates ready for WebSocket integration

## 📊 Usage Statistics

The likes collection structure supports future analytics:
- Most liked posts identification
